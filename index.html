              In a world where AI outpaces human knowledge, IQ alone is no
              longer enough. Dr. Elaine Loo equips families, educators, and
              leaders with the full spectrum of intelligences, emotional (EQ),
              adaptive (AQ), social (SQ), and self-awareness (UQ). So human
              potential doesn’t just survive, but thrives.

              Her pioneering 5Q MindVehicle™ Framework has inspired families,
              uplifted schools, and guided organizations across Asia and beyond.
              From keynote stages in India, Finland, and Austria to parenting
              programs on the ground, her mission is simple: the more people who
              live with 5Q, the stronger our communities and the brighter our
              future.
